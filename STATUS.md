# TaskbarUtil Project Status

## ✅ Completed

### Core Infrastructure
- ✅ Created GitHub repository: https://github.com/windowsadmins/taskbarutil
- ✅ Set up C# .NET 8.0 project structure
- ✅ Added Apache 2.0 license (same as dockutil)
- ✅ Comprehensive README with usage examples
- ✅ .gitignore for .NET projects

### Code Architecture
- ✅ Command-line interface using System.CommandLine
- ✅ Modular design with separate Core and Commands namespaces
- ✅ TaskbarManager class for core functionality
- ✅ TaskbarItem and supporting data structures
- ✅ Command pattern implementation for all operations

### Features Implemented
- ✅ `add` command - Pin applications to taskbar
- ✅ `remove` command - Unpin applications (including "remove all")
- ✅ `list` command - List all pinned items
- ✅ `find` command - Search for specific items
- ✅ `move` command - Placeholder (documented as limited)
- ✅ Version and help commands
- ✅ Verbose output option
- ✅ No-restart option

### Testing & Quality
- ✅ Unit test project with xUnit
- ✅ Basic test coverage for data structures
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Automated builds and releases

### Documentation & Examples
- ✅ Comprehensive README with examples
- ✅ PowerShell example scripts for workstation setup
- ✅ Developer workstation setup script
- ✅ Office workstation setup script
- ✅ Example usage documentation

### Windows Integration
- ✅ Windows-specific registry access
- ✅ Shortcut (.lnk) file handling
- ✅ Explorer.exe restart functionality
- ✅ Environment variable expansion
- ✅ Path resolution for common application locations

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Windows Taskbar Restrictions
- **Move/Reorder operations**: Windows doesn't provide a reliable programmatic API for reordering taskbar items. Users must manually drag items to reorder.
- **Registry complexity**: The taskbar registry format is undocumented and complex. Current implementation relies primarily on shortcut files.
- **Permissions**: Some operations may require administrator privileges.

### Current Implementation Notes
- Uses Windows shortcuts (.lnk files) in `%AppData%\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch\User Pinned\TaskBar`
- Registry parsing is basic due to undocumented format
- Move functionality is documented as limited due to Windows API restrictions

## 🔄 Potential Future Enhancements

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Improved registry parsing for better taskbar state detection
- [ ] Support for Windows Store apps (UWP applications)
- [ ] URL pinning support
- [ ] Folder pinning with custom display options
- [ ] Spacer tile support (if possible)

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Backup and restore taskbar configurations
- [ ] Import/export taskbar layouts
- [ ] Group policy integration
- [ ] PowerShell module wrapper
- [ ] GUI configuration tool

### Developer Experience
- [ ] More comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests on actual Windows systems
- [ ] Benchmarking and performance tests
- [ ] Code coverage reporting
